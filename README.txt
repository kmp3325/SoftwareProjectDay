Our program requires Java 8 to compile and run.
The main method is inside of the Main class.
There are no program arguments, but a constant for the percent chance of a question being asked can be changed within the file Employee.java by changing the static constant CHANCE_FOR_QUESTION_ON_GIVEN_MINUTE.

The output will be displayed as follows:
[timestamp] [Manager or Employee number & teamNumber] [task]
The end of the output will display all metrics for each person.
